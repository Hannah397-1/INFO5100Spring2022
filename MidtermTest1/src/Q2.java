     *
     *    ** How to use them:
     *     Interface: The keyword is "implements"
     *     Abstract class: The keyword is "extends"
     *
     *   1. An interface does not contain any concrete methods. All the methods in interface are abstract methods.
     *   An abstract class can contain concrete methods. If there is an abstract method inside a class, the class is abstract class.
     *
     *   2. A class can implements multiple interface,
     *   but a class can only extends one abstract class.
     *
     *   3. An abstract class can have access modifier, but interface does not have access modifiers.
     *   any components inside the interface is assumed public access modifier.
     *
     *   4. Attributes in attribute class cannot be change outside the interface, they are "final"
     *   but attributes in abstract class can be changed outside it.
     *
     *   5. An interface can't inherit a class but can inherit multiple interfaces.
     *   An abstract class can inherit a class and multiple interfaces
